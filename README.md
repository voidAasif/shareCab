# 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Aasif**, a passionate developer who loves building useful software solutions.  
I enjoy turning ideas into real, working applications that make life easier.  
This project is one of the ways I’m exploring how technology can help people in their everyday routines.

# 🚖 What is ShareCab?

**ShareCab** is a simple backend system designed to help people **share cab rides easily**.

Imagine if you’re going somewhere and someone else is also heading in the same direction —  
instead of taking separate cabs, you both can **share the ride** and save money, fuel, and time.

This system helps:
- 🧍‍♂️ People find other riders nearby  
- 📍 Share ride details  
- 🕒 Save time and travel together  
- 💸 Make travel more affordable and efficient  

Right now, it works behind the scenes (the backend part), and **my friend is currently working on developing a website** to make it easy for users to interact with the system.
